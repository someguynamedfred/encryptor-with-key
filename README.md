# String encrypter and decrypter
Super basic python code that encrypts and decrypts string input. 
If pre-encrypted key is less than 15 characters long, it will add "salt" to the code. 
In order to decrypt, you will need the access key (you can change it in line eight of the key.py file)

Feel free to use this code for any projects. I don't suggesting using this code if you are actually looking to protect your private data.
